# benthos
From Ancient Greek βένθος (bénthos) 'the depths (of the sea)', is the community of organisms that live on, in, or near the bottom of a sea, river, lake, or stream, also known as the benthic zone.

benthos is a backend service written in go, meant to be used as a starting point for any REST API web server project.
